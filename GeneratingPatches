Follow these steps to generate a patch that can be merged by committer:
=======================================================================
    Check out the Anwesha-CTF source from the git repository.
    Make the changes necessary for your particular issue while following the code conventions found in CODE_CONVENTIONS. Try to avoid unnecessary changes, such as extra whitespace or formatting changes. 
    Generate a patch with git diff --no-prefix ctf15 > Anwehsha-CTF-{ISSUE_NUMBER}.patch. For subsequent patches, if necessary, number each version to make it easier for reviewers to track their progress.
    Upload your diff to any review board and invite committer for review. A committer should review the patch shortly and either provide feedback for a new version, or commit it to the Anwesha-CTF source.
